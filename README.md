Dataset of synthetically generated handwritten pages intended for research on
full page text and entity recognition. The data was generated using the tool in
https://github.com/manucarbonell/ and data taken from https://gmb.let.rug.nl/.

Use [nw-page-editor](https://github.com/mauvilsa/nw-page-editor) to visualize
the xmls. To get a nicer visualization of the annotated entities load the css
included in this repository as follows: `nw-page-editor --css
code/nw-page-editor-entities.css data`.
